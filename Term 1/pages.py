You stay with Serena's people, one of the many
tribes of Dervishes, for several days while she
manages to get word secretly to Bruce that you
are safe.
At last Bruce and Andrea arrive at the village.
"Thank goodness you're all right," says Bruce.
"Andrea and I followed your trail to the cafe. The
police raided the place and uncovered a nest of
foreign agents code named SPHINX. But by then
you were gone. Later, when we returned to the
hotel, we found Serena's note telling us where
you were.
"Unfortunately, I had to tell your parents that
you were missing. They have been very worried. I
guess you'd better catch a plane home and show
them that you are really all right. I am sorry you
had only one day in Egypt."
Back in the States, whenever you see the
dawn, you think of those white-robed figures
chanting their hymns to the first light of day.
You weren't in Egypt very long, but it was an
adventure you'll never forget.

You ride for another few hours. There is utter
silence except for the clip-clop of the donkey's
hooves and the creak of the wheels. You drift off
to sleep. Sometime later Serena shakes you
gently.
"We are here, at my village, and with my people."
You crawl out of the cart. Dawn is just breaking.
You are near a field. In the center you see a large

white turbans and white robes. They are chanting
in unison—it's an eerie sound. Then the figures
rise and begin to move together around the fire in
a strange, slow dance, rolling their heads and

Serena  leads you  down  a  long  flight  of stairs.
